# The Library
For now, we are using [Mr Addict's Pi Pico SSD1306 C/C++ Library](https://github.com/MR-Addict/Pi-Pico-SSD1306-C-Library). This is temporary in that we do not intend to use the SSD1306 OLED display for the entire project.

Currently, our main troubles involve a seemingly corrupted VSCode/Pi Pico SDK installation, and we are attempting to figure out why it is not working.
