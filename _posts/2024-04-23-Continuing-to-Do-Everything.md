# Literally the entire post
Sooooooo. I've implemented the ability for a "graceful" disconnection between the central device and the peripheral sensor device. That's all. I haven't had the time or motivation to do much anything else being the only one making any meaningful progress on the project. I've been casually wondering if I would've enjoyed being part of a different team. Do my team members even read these posts?
