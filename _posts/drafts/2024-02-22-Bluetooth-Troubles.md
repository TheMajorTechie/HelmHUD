# The Beginning
Right off the bat, [download the UF2 file for the Pico W here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html). This is a UF2 file and as such is precompiled. Drop it on the Pico W while it's in programming mode.

Next, install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). This is the IDE that is officially mentioned by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. For this tutorial, I will be once again displaying to the SSD1306 OLED display over I2C using [this](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/ssd1306.html) guide off the micropython docs.

(More to come later. This post will be updated with time.)
