# Project Start
Here we go!

Our initial plans:
* Use an RPi Pico as the core microcontroller platform
* Ideally uses a projector rather than a conventional LCD or OLED display to reduce the chance of becoming a distraction and to increase durability
* The first step will be to successfully read Bluetooth data off of a sensor (initial API testing)
* Start with a heart rate sensor (fitbit?); look into sourcing discrete sensors as another possibility.

#### First milestone: successfully read sensor data over bluetooth

#### Stretch goal: Phone-based app?
